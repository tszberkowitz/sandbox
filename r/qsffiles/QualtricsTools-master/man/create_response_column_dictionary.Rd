}
\arguments{

the survey's questions inserted appropriately into them.}

\item{original_first_row}{this is the first row of the response data CSV, it is
automatically provided to you when you use get_setup() or in the shiny application.}

\item{flow}{A list of strings identifying the blocks in the order that they appear
within the survey. Extract this form the survey QSF with `flow_from_survey`.}
}
\value{

}
\description{
By providing the questions structured by their blocks and the original first
row of the response CSV from Qualtrics, this function is able to create a
dictionary where each row is an entry for a response column. The response
columns are listed along with the data export tag of the question they correspond
to, their question stem and question choice, the question types (1, 2, and 3 levels
of question types!), and the response type.
