\title{Create the Results Table for a Matrix Single Answer Question}
\usage{
matrix_single_answer_results(question, original_first_rows)
}
\arguments{
\item{question}{This is a list object representing an individual question
from a Qualtrics Survey File. The question must have a paired
response column placed into the question
under [['Responses']]. The insertion of the responses into questions is
handled by link_responses_to_questions.}

\item{original_first_rows}{A dataframe contianing the header information
for each column of response data. This dataframe includes a row for the DataExportTag based
response column names, another for the Question Text stem and choice text (although
truncated), and a row with QID based column names.}
}
\value{
a table with the matrix-sub-questions listed
in the first column, the percentages for each
choice for each sub-question listed in a table, and
then another column with the total respondents
for each subquestion.
}
\description{
The matrix_single_answer_results function uses the
definition of the choices and answers in the
QSF file and their potentially recoded values to
determine how to table the results paired
to that question. If you look at the source code,
keep in mind that a matrix question's sub-questions
are called "Choices" and that the choices for each
sub-question are called "Answers". This function is also used
to table results for single answer  multiple choice questions
with N/A options indicated by negative integer recode values.
