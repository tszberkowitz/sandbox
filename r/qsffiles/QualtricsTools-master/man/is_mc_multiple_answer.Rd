Each of the is-functions defined in the qualtrics package are used
for determining which response parsing function should be used. A
function is considered multiple choice if it is listed in
the qsf file as having [['Payload']][['QuestionType']] == "MC"
(standing for Multiple Choice), and the `[['Payload']][['Selector']]` is set to one of the
following:
"Multiple Answer Vertical",
"Multiple Answer Horizontal",
"Multiple Choice Select Box",
"Multiple Answer Column",
}
