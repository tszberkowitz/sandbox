\title{Split Respondents by a Response Column}
\usage{
split_respondents(
  response_column,
  responses,
  survey,
  blocks,
  questions,
  headerrows,
  already_loaded,
  original_first_rows
)
}
\arguments{
\item{response_column}{The response column that will be used to split the respondents}

\item{responses}{A dataframe of Qualtrics responses to a survey.
Use ask_for_csv() to create such a dataframe from a CSV file.}

\item{survey}{A qualtrics survey list object,
uploaded from a Qualtrics Survey File (QSF). Use
ask_for_qsf() to create such a survey list object from a QSF file.}

\item{blocks}{The blocks provided to this function must include questions inserted into
the BlockElements. Extract the list of block and the list of questions from the survey
with `valid_questions_blocks_from_survey` and add necessary information with `add_question_detail`,
then insert questions into the blocks
with `insert_questions_into_blocks`.

Question dictionaries require that each question already have items for QuestionTextClean
and human readable question type. If you have not already prepared questions and blocks for
this, use `question_dictionary_from_qsf` to generate a question dictionary from the QSF directly.}

\item{already_loaded}{This can be set to TRUE to indicate that the survey and responses
should be sourced from the global scope; in other words that the survey and its responses
have are "already loaded."}

\item{original_first_rows}{A dataframe contianing the header information
for each column of response data. This dataframe includes a row for the DataExportTag based
response column names, another for the Question Text stem and choice text (although
truncated), and a row with QID based column names.}
}
\value{
A list of a list of blocks. The same question, but with different respondent groups,
might look something like split_blocks[[1]][[1]][['BlockElements']][[1]] and
split_blocks[[2]][[1]][['BlockElements']][[1]]. These refer to the first and second respondent
groups, the first block, and the first block element.
}
\description{
This function splits the respondents into separate respondent groups
based on the values in the specified response column. Then, for each
respondent group, the blocks with questions are duplicated. Each set of
blocks has a different responent group inserted into its questions, and
then each set of blocks is processed. The output is a list of blocks with
the results processed and inserted into each BlockElement.
