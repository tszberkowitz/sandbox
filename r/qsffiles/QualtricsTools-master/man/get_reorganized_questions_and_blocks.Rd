\title{Get Restructured Questions (with inserted Responses)
and Blocks (with inserted Questions) from data
provided by Qualtrics.}
\usage{
get_reorganized_questions_and_blocks(survey, responses, original_first_rows)
}
\arguments{
\item{survey}{A qualtrics survey list object,
uploaded from a Qualtrics Survey File (QSF). Use
ask_for_qsf() to create such a survey list object from a QSF file.}

\item{responses}{A dataframe of Qualtrics responses to a survey.
Use ask_for_csv() to create such a dataframe from a CSV file.}

\item{original_first_rows}{A dataframe contianing the header information
for each column of response data. This dataframe includes a row for the DataExportTag based
response column names, another for the Question Text stem and choice text (although
truncated), and a row with QID based column names.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements: the questions,
and the survey blocks. All questions in the trash are
excluded, HTML and CSS are removed from question text,
responses, notes, and a more easily human readable question
type are inserted into each question. The blocks then have
their BlockElements replaced by corresponding questions
where applicable. The BlockElements of the list of Blocks
from a survey originally only refer to questions
by their DataExportTag. However, this is inconvenient
because it adds an additional lookup step, and so they are
replaced by the real objects here. Questions is a named list for which names
are data export tags. Blocks containing questions have Block Elements for these
questions named with the Data Export Tags.
}
\description{
This function returns a list with two elements, where
the first element is questions with their responses
and results-tables listed in them, and secondly
the blocks of the survey, with questions listed in
each block as BlockElements.
