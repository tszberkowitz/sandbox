\description{
The user provides this function a character vector of names of response columns (
as the panel_columns var), along with the response set data frame, and the returned
data is a data frame with respondent IDs and column(s) for each column specified.
If the optional parameters, lean_responses and question_dict are provided, then
the function will use them to include a "Raw Response" and a "Coded Response"
column for any columns which are question response columns.
