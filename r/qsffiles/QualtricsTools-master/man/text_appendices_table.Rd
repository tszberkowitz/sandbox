\description{
This function creates an HTML string with tables
for each of the text entry questions and their text_responses.
The appendix_lettering function inside this function
is to create lettering for the tables in the style
of "A, B, ..., Z, AA, ..., ZZ" and so forth. The html
tables are created by looping through the blocks
and their contained question block elements. For each
question, if the question is a Text Entry question or
any of the response columns contain "TEXT" then a table
is created for those text_responses.
